# Welcome to the PIQI Alliance GitHub Repository

Welcome to the **PIQI Alliance** repository! This project aims to enhance the implementation of the PIQI Framework within a community of practice. Below you'll find an overview of the framework, its components, and how you can contribute.

## Overview

The **PIQI Framework** is designed to be implemented within a community of practice. This collaborative approach leverages the expertise of various sector partners, including healthcare providers, health information technology companies, patient advocacy groups, and regulatory bodies. By sharing knowledge and evolving together, the community can rapidly adopt and improve the framework, ensuring it meets the evolving needs of patient-oriented care

The community of practice supports the PIQI Framework by:
- **Promoting Cross-Sector Collaboration**: Encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among diverse stakeholders to develop and implement the framework
- **Standardizing Data Quality Assessments**: Establishing a standardized framework and taxonomy for healthcare data quality to ensure uniformity in data handling practices.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Emphasizing ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure continuous improvement in data quality.
- **Providing Training and Resources**: Offering training sessions and resources to healthcare providers for effective implementation of the quality improvement framework.
- **Facilitating Seamless Content Sharing**: Registering and certifying implementations of the PIQI Framework to enable seamless content sharing among community members.

## PIQI Model Extensions

The PIQI Framework starts with a simple model intended to support the assessment of core clinical patient data. The simplicity of this model allows for extension through the addition of attributes, elements, and data classes. Ideally, these extensions would be adopted into the core PIQI model through a standard process.

## Shared Simple Assessment Modules

While many of the foundational, attribute-level SAMs are algorithmic, SAMs that apply to codable concepts, elements, data classes, and patient-level data often require structured content in the form of value sets, tuples, and other data patterns. These data packages can be openly shared or licensed in a community portal. More sophisticated algorithmic SAMs, perhaps based on generative AI, could also be hosted as RESTful services through wrapper SAM interfaces.

## Shared Evaluation Profiles

While the evaluation profiles in The PIQI Framework are designed to be configured to support the needs of the implementer, the ability to establish sanctioned standard evaluation profiles is one of the most beneficial features of The PIQI Framework. The ability to publish and share an evaluation profile, along with its dependent SAMs and PIQI Information Model components, can minimize duplication of effort and provide a powerful way to create a common basis for understanding data quality across the community.

## PIQI Endpoint Registration

Within the community of practice, implementations of The PIQI Framework could be registered and certified to facilitate the ability to share content seamlessly with other community members.
